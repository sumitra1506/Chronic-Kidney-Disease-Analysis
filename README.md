# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Analysis

1.1. Overview:-
Chronic kidney disease is a global health burden with a high economic cost to health systems and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease(CVD).All stages of CKD are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular morbidity,premature mortality and decreased quality of life.CKD is usually asymptomatic until later stages and accurate prevalence data are lacking.Thus we sought to determine the prevalence of CKD globally,by stage,geographical location,gender and age.

1.2. Purpose:-
The aim of the present study was to systematically review published economic models that simulated long term outcomes of kidney disease to inform cost-effectiveness evaluation of CKD treatments.Chronic kidney disease is a major medical problem and can be cured if treated it in the early stages.Usually people are not aware that medical tests ,taking different purposes could contain valuable information concerning kidney disease.


2.LITERATURE SURVEY
2.1. Existing Problem:-
The kidneys are highly vascularized, meaning they contains lots of blood vessels.So blood vessel disease are generally dangerous to kidneys.The two main causes of CKD are diabetes and high blood pressure which are responsible for up to two-thirds of the cases.Progressive CKD is linked to several complications with higher prevalence and intensity at lower levels of kidney function.Some of these complications can be readily defined and quantified as cardiovascular disease,hypertension,anemia,mineral bone disorder,volume overload,electrolytes and acid-base abnormalities etc.       
37 million people in the United States are living with chronic kidney disease.
The burden of CKD in India can not be assessed acurately.The approximate prevalence of CKD is 800 per million population(pmp),and the incidence of end-stage renal disease(ESRD) is 150-200 pmp.

2.2. Proposed Solution:-
For the treatment of any disease,availability of therapy and its affordability are two important issues.If a person have diabetes or high blood pressure, working with the doctor to keep blood sugar and blood pressure under control is the best way to prevent kidney disease.Follow a low-salt,low-fat diet,Excercise atleast 30 minutes on most days of the week,Have regular check the sugar and pressure in the blood.Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors(ACEis) or angiotensin-receptor blockers(ARBs) comprise the standard of care for treatment of diabetic nephropathy as well as many other forms of CKD.If the kidneys can't keep up with waste and fluid clearance on their own then the person develop complete or near-complete kidney failure and have end stage kidney disease.At that point dialysis or kidney transplant is needed.Regeneraive medicine approaches may be developed in the future to help slow progression of the disease.
